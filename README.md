This project is a derivative of the original PIFuHD implementation, with modifications for 3D printing in mind.
It implements PIFuHD (Multi-Level Pixel-Aligned Implicit Function for High-Resolution 3D Human Digitization), a state-of-the-art method for generating high-resolution 3D human models from single images.
Enhancements made specifically for 3D printing nebula technosys:
PiFUHD had notebook wasn't working due to pytorch numpy compatibility issue, solved by manually changing lib functions, now working fine.

Please be aware that 3D printing from complex 3D models may require further editing or optimization using their domain specific tools and applications.
